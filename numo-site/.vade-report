Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report
==========================================

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

Changes Implemented:
--------------------

1. **Package Installation**
   - Installed @vercel/analytics v1.6.1 using pnpm
   - Package added to dependencies in package.json
   - Created pnpm-lock.yaml lockfile (project uses pnpm as package manager)

2. **Layout Configuration** (src/app/layout.tsx)
   - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
   - Placed <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag after {children}
   - This follows the recommended pattern for Next.js App Router projects

Files Modified:
--------------
- package.json - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- src/app/layout.tsx - Added Analytics import and component
- pnpm-lock.yaml - Created/updated with new dependency tree

Implementation Details:
----------------------
- Project Type: Next.js 16.0.7 with App Router (src/app directory structure)
- Package Manager: pnpm (detected and used for installation)
- Analytics Component Placement: Inside <body> tag, after children (standard best practice)
- Build Status: ✓ Successfully compiled and built
- TypeScript: ✓ Type checking passed

Verification:
------------
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ Dependencies installed correctly
✓ Lock file updated

The Analytics component will automatically start tracking page views and Web Vitals when deployed to Vercel with analytics enabled in the project settings.

Note: The linter showed some pre-existing warnings in src/app/page.tsx that are unrelated to this implementation. These warnings existed before the analytics installation and were not introduced by these changes.
